A retro inspired Space Shooter arcade game created in React Native using RN Game Engine (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-game-engine). I wanted to create a game in React Native as a proof of concept. I was unsure if I would be able to create something with numerous entities on screen and still run with a 16ms draw rate (60 fps). However, I was pleasantly surprised I was able to achieve this with some simple optimizations (mostly a spatial hash map). Hoping to create some more complex games in the future. 


The game is live on Google's Play Store at https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?account=7662049949279524420#AppDashboardPlace:p=com.isjustgame.spaceshooter&appid=4973516796129715569.
